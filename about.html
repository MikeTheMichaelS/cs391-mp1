                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello, this is Yiyun Sun. A student at the Boston University.</p>
                <p>I am a senior studying Computer Science. I am passionate about technology and always eager to learn
                    new things.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Shanghai, China, and attended my elementary school and middle school there.</p>
                <p>After that, I attended high school and college in the United States.</p>
                <p>Due to my past experiences, I am bilingual in Chinese (Mandarin) and English.</p>
                <p>I also learned a little bit of Spanish in high school, and a little bit of Japanese in university.
                </p>
                <p>I attended robotics contest when I was in high school. It always suprised me that modern technology
                    is able to control machines doing amazing things and achieving amazing goals.</p>
                <p>I am also interested in hardware field. I like to play with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. These opened
                    the gate of IoT to me. I am also interested in developing IoT gadgets.</p>
